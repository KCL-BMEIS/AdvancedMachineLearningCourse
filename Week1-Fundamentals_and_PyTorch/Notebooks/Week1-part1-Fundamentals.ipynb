        "The basic biological unit of brain computation is a neuronal cell (see figure below). Each cell is essentially an electrical device that receives signals at the dendrites (surrounding the cell body) and, once these exceed a threshold, transmits the signal down the cell axon to synaptic terminals, where it then connects with other cells.\n",

        "Artificial neurons are designed to mimic this process, but only in a limited or constrained way. The idea is that the modulatory effect of the different synaptic connections is modelled through linear multiplication  of input signals $x_i$ with weights $w_i$, plus a bias term which shifts the centre of the prediction from zero. If the final sum is high enough, modelled through an nonlinear activation function $f$, the artificial neuron is allowed to ‘fire’ in response to that pattern of activation. \n",

In truth design of many components of the most common artificial networks used for computer vision today are more inspired by engineering choices than any true goal to replicate human brain function. Biologically inspired neural networks  exist but, to an extent, they are a are a separate and  distinct line of research.\n",
